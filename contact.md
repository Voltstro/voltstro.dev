# Contact

Here are some ways to contact me! Further down there are also some of my social media platforms.

Don't bother spamming me! I just ignore or don't read the message if it looks like spam!

### Email:

If you wanna contact me via email.

You can email me at: [me@voltstro.dev](mailto:me@voltstro.dev)

### Discord:

If you need help with projects of mine or yours, you may wanna ask in the Voltstro Discord server. I or others may be able to help you with your problem.

Discord Server: [Join Here](https://discord.voltstro.dev)

### Twitter

A fairly easy way to contact me, use this way as more of a last resort! I don't check my Twitter as much as my emails or my Discord server. Expect there to be a bit of a delay for a reply.

Twitter: [@Voltstro](https://twitter.com/Voltstro)
