# Contact

Here are some ways to contact me! Further down there are also some of my social media platforms.

Don't bother spamming me! I just ignore or don't read the message if it looks like spam!

### Email:

This is the **RECOMMEND** and **BEST** way to contact me, if you contact me via email, it is almost 100% guaranteed that I will see and read your message.

You can email me at: [me@voltstro.dev](mailto:me@voltstro.dev)

### Discord:

This is the second most **RECOMMEND** way to contact me, as well others. If you need help with projects of mine, this is the **BEST** place to ask as others may be able to help you solve your issue! You can also come and chat with us!

Discord Server: [Join Here](https://discord.voltstro.dev)

### Twitter

A fairly easy way to contact me, use this way as more of a last resort! I don't check my Twitter as much as my emails or my Discord server. Except there to be a bit of a delay for a reply.
