Hey everyone, long time no post. Anyway I am here to tell you about Pootis-Bot Version 1.0.0 is finally out! You can download it [here](https://pootis-bot.voltstro.dev/download/).

What does this mean? Will Pootis still receive updates?

Yes of course it will still receive fixes and updates! It probably will always get updates.

Another note with Pootis-Bot, that its initial code was uploaded on the 24th of December, 2018, and today is the 24th of December, 2019. So exactly one year after Pootis's code was uploaded you get the release version of Pootis!

This is also the first piece of software that I have just created that has been released! Kind of special, I guess, not really.

Also, merry Christmas from everyone at Creepysin Studios and from me, Creepysin! Its a little bit to early to say that, its still Christmas Eve, but its Christmas Day in like 2 hours for me anyway.

Hope to see you in the next decade, 2020!
