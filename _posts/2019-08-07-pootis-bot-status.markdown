Hello everyone it has been awhile since I have posted, but I am here to give an update on [Pootis-Bot](https://pootis-bot.voltstro.dev) and some other stuff as well.

What I really want to do with Pootis-Bot is to have it released by the end of this year! Now I can't exactly tell when, as still I have no idea either, but still it is nearing completion.

Now about the audio services.

This part of Pootis-Bot has always been a challenge for me, this sort of stuff isn't what I am good at. I originally wanted Pootis-Bot to run on all platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS) but getting it to run on all three platforms has been hard. So I have made the decision that Pootis-Bot audio service will only work on Windows. Now this won't effect the rest of Pootis-Bot at all, just the audio services.

Now the audio service could be made to run on Linux and MacOS, but I just don't have the time and I don't have a Mac to test audio services on MacOS.

All right now updates on some other stuff.

Why haven't I been active? Simple, its call school and there have been some shit ass assessments and exams. But that is not the only reason why I haven't been active, I have also been working on some personal projects.

Now for YouTube updates... THANK YOU FOR 100 SUBSCRIBERS! I never would have expect to hit that number of subs, I created Creepysin just for fun. Now I know 100 isn't a big number, especially now days YouTube, but still thats big for me, so thank you again!

So yea, thats it, I hope you have a good day and goodbye!
